feat: 🚀 Introduce React Practice Files

👩‍💻 This commit adds practice files for React, exploring different approaches and features in three variations:

1. Vanilla JavaScript: A basic example creating a div element with text content and applying styles using JavaScript.
2. React.createElement: Utilizing React.createElement to create a simple React component with ReactDOM.createRoot for rendering.
3. JSX with Babel: Incorporating JSX with Babel and ReactDOM.createRoot for a more concise and expressive React component.

🌐 Each HTML file showcases a different technique, providing a hands-on learning experience for React beginners. Happy coding! 🚀
